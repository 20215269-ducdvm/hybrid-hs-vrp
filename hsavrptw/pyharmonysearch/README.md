provides a simple introduction on how HS works. Also, see
the [HS Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_search).

HS was first introduced by Geem et al. in 2001:

Z. W. Geem, J. H. Kim, and G. V. Loganathan, "A New Heuristic Optimization Algorithm: Harmony Search," Simulation, vol.
76, no. 2, pp. 60–68, Feb. 2001.

Some modifications and improvements have been suggested to the original algorithm. None of these are implemented here.
This package only implements the original algorithm.
